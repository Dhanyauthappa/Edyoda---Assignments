1.  Which type of loop(s) is/are not supported by Python?
Answer: Python supports for and while loops only. Python does not have the do while loop.

2.What statement can be used inside a loop to skip the rest of the code for the current iteration, so execution can continue with the next iteration?
Answer:The continue statement is used inside a loop to skip the rest of the code for the current iteration, so execution can continue with the next iteration.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.Which loop in Python is a counter-controlled loop?
Answer: In Python, for loop is a counter-controlled loop. The counter determines how many times the for loop executes.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.What Python statement can be used to bring control out of the current loop?
Answer : In Python, break statement brings control out of the current loop in which it is present.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.What is for loop?
Answer : A for loop is typically used when you know exactly how many times the loop needs to be repeated. A while loop is typically used when you don't know how many times the loop needs to be repeated.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. What is while loop?
Answer : A while loop repeats as long as its condition is true. For example, if a while loop says "while x == 5", then the line will execute as long as x equals five.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7.What is the Python syntax for a for loop?
Answer : The syntax for Python for loops is:

for x in range(y): do something
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8. What are the advantages of using a for loop in Python?
Answer :A for loop is a type of loop that executes a set of instructions repeatedly. It uses the following syntax: for x in range(y): do something
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9.What are the disadvantages of using a for loop in Python?
Answer:The for-loop is one of the most basic constructs in programming. However, this construct has its own disadvantages.

If you don't know the upper-bound of your loop, you have to keep track of it by hand or break out of your loop early.
You can't use a break statement to escape from a nested loop.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10.How can I use a break statement in my Python for loops?
Answer: A break statement can be used to terminate a loop. It is often used when the programmer needs to stop iterating through the data and instead go back to checking for other conditions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11.What is Else Clause with Python For Loop?
Answer : Python allows using an optional else statement along with the “for” loop.

The code under the else clause executes after the completion of the “for” loop. However, if the loop stops due to a “break” call, then it’ll skip the “else” clause.

12. What are the 3 types of loops in Python?
Answer: Type of Loops
For Loop. A for loop in Python is used to iterate over a sequence (list, tuple, set, dictionary, and string). Flowchart: ...
While Loop. The while loop is used to execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true. ...
Nested Loop. If a loop exists inside the body of another loop, it is called a nested loop.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
13. What is  Nested Loop?
Answer :If a loop exists inside the body of another loop, it is called a nested loop.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
14.Which loop is most used in Python?
Answer: In python, a while loop is used to execute a block of statements repeatedly until a given condition is satisfied.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
15.What is Loop Control Statements?
Answer :Loop control statements change execution from its normal sequence. When execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
16.What is break statement?
Answer: Terminates the loop statement and transfers execution to the statement immediately following the loop.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
17.What is continue statement?
Answer: Causes the loop to skip the remainder of its body and immediately retest its condition prior to reiterating.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
18. What is pass statement?
Answer :The pass statement in Python is used when a statement is required syntactically but you do not want any command or code to execute.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
19.What is range() function? 
Answer :Using a for loop with range(), we can repeat an action a specific number of times.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
20.What are the 3 parameters used in a for loop in Python?
Answer: Range with three parameters: start, end, step.
